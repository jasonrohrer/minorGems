// creates a ticket record and returns a ticket code

server.php
?action=sell_ticket
&name=[human name]
&email=[email address]
&reference=[order number]
&tags=[ticket_type]
&security_data=[data]
&security_hash=[md5 hash]

ticket_type can be:

april_9
april_12



// checks if download code is valid

server.php
?action=check_ticket
&ticket_id=[ID]

Return:
VALID
-or-
INVALID




// gets email address associated with a download ticket

server.php
?action=get_ticket_email
&ticket_id=[ID]

Return:
email
-or-
INVALID




// shows download links

server.php
?action=show_downloads
&ticket_id=[ID]



// serve a file

server.php
?action=download
&ticket_id=[ID]
&file_name=[file name]




// gets a user's download code (encrypted)

server.php
?action=get_ticket_id
&email=[email address]


Returned code is encrypted in the following fashion:


  substring( toBits( HMAC_SHA1( $sharedEncryptionSecret, $email ) ), LENGTH ) 
  XOR 
  toBits( ticket_id )


Where LENGTH is the number of bits in ticket_id.  If LENGTH is longer than
160 bits (sha1 length), extra bits are generated and appended via:

  HMAC_SHA1( $sharedEncryptionSecret,
             HMAC_SHA1( $sharedEncryptionSecret, $email ) )

If more bits are needed, extra bits are generated and appended via:

  HMAC_SHA1( $sharedEncryptionSecret,
             HMAC_SHA1( $sharedEncryptionSecret,
                        HMAC_SHA1( $sharedEncryptionSecret, $email ) ) )

And so on.


ticket_id values are in "readable base-32", which is base 32 with possibly
confused characters (0/O and 1/I) removed for readability, and hyphens added
to break the string into clusters of 5 digits.

Numbers 0, ..., 31 are encoded by the following characters:

"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", "M",
"N", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"


toBits simply converts a given encoding (hex or base-32) into binary.


and XOR is a bit-wise XOR operation.


The resulting bit string is re-encoded in readable base-32, without hyphens



Returns DENIED if email not found or user blocked.






// verifies a hash using a user's secret ticket_id as the key
// this allows remote checking of download codes without sending them accross

server.php
?action=check_ticket_hash
&email=[email address]
&hash_value=[hash value]
&string_to_hash=[string]


Return:
VALID
-or-
INVALID


string_to_hash must contain only the charcters 0-9, A-Z, and a-z

hash_value is computed on both ends with:

HMAC_SHA1( $ticket_id, $string_to_hash )


Where $ticket_id has hyphens removed and is all uppercase.


Note that string_to_hash should not be re-used for subsequent checks to avoid
replay attacks.  HOWEVER, the ticketServer does NOT track this or prevent
replays.  It is up to the other server to handle this.
